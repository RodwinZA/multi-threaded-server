# Server Client Example

This repo contains an example of a multi-threaded server with Timeout.

- When cloning split the `server` and `client` folders into two seperate projects.
- Replace the package names with those of your project.
- First run the server project and then client/multiple clients.


## Timeout

The timeout is set to 15 seconds. Change/remove this by editing the following code:

<small>server/Echoer.java</small>
```
Thread.sleep(value);
```
